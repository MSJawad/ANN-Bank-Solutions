# ANN-Bank-Solutions
An artificial neural network that predicts, based on the given data set of a particular bank, 
whether a customer is likely to leave the bank.

## Concepts used
Artificial Neural Networks
Backpropogation
Reinforced Learning etc

After the initial neural network had been built, a lot of the code after was used to check and improve the accuracy,
and implemented methods such as dropout for a more independent batch of nodes, hence improving accuracies on the testing set

## Dependancies
Keras
tflearn
scikit-learn
math

"This ANN was made as a homework assignment for the "Neural Networks in Python" course Im taking on Udemy. Its proven to be
super helpful and i urge everyone to give it a try"
